Description: Rserve acts as a socket server (TCP/IP or local sockets) 
	     which allows binary requests to be sent to R. Rservecoop is
		 an adaptation of the Rserve package which operates in
		 cooperative mode, i.e. only one shared workspace exists.
		 This enables applications such as data servers.
